# Quantifying-the-depth-of-multipartite-entanglement
This software is designed to detect and quantify the depth of multipartite entanglement in quantum states. It currently supports four system sizes: 2-qubit, 3-qubit, 4-qubit, and 5-qubit. For any state within these dimensions, the program computes the corresponding $k$-partite entanglement measures (i.e., the depth of multipartite entanglement). 
User Manual for Multipartite Entanglement Detection Software
1. Software Overview

This software is designed to detect and quantify the depth of multipartite entanglement (also referred to as k-partite entanglement) in quantum states.
It currently supports four system sizes:

2-qubit

3-qubit

4-qubit

5-qubit

For any state within these dimensions, the program automatically computes the corresponding entanglement depth. The interface provides:

Detection Result: Classification of the input state according to its $k$-partite entanglement.

Elapsed Time: The computation time required for the detection.

The software features a clean, intuitive design and requires no programming knowledge, making it suitable for both research and educational purposes.
